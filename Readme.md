# Indexing all Go Concepts

A comprehensive educational repository and reference hub for the Go (Golang) programming language. This project is designed as a multi-module workspace that indexes various Go concepts, ranging from core language features to specific frameworks and advanced interoperability.

## Project Objective
This repository serves as a developer’s "Playbook," targeting anyone from intermediate learners to advanced developers looking to refresh their knowledge on Go's nuances through hands-on implementations.

## Core Targets & Focus Areas
- **Concurrency Mastery**: Patterns and examples for writing efficient parallel code using Goroutines and Channels.
- **Web Development**: Building high-performance services using the **Gin** framework.
- **Low-Level Interoperability**: Understanding Go's interaction with C libraries via **CGO**.
- **Interview & Problem Solving**: Structured challenges to practice common Go-specific algorithmic and architectural problems.
- **DevOps Readiness**: Full development lifecycle examples including containerization (Docker) and build automation.

## Sub-Projects
- [🚀 Go-Routines](./modules/learn-routines/) - Concurrency patterns and examples.
- [🔗 CGO](./modules/learn-cgo/) - Interoperability between Go and C.
- [🌐 GIN Framework](./modules/learn-gin/) - High-performance web development.
- [🧠 Interview Practice](./modules/go-interview-practise/) - Algorithmic and Go-specific challenges.
